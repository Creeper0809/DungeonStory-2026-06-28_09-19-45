# DungeonStory Active Plan

## Goal

Complete the approved level-50 character growth and skill system on top of the finished dungeon-linked expedition loop:

```text
prepare owner + two staff -> choose permanent level-one skills
-> gain levels, stats, actives, passives, and narrative history
-> use management/defense/offense skills in their real domains
-> persist exact world profiles and choices -> reach level 50 ultimate
```

## Product Decisions

- Party size remains 3 and the owner cannot join.
- Party positions are front, middle, and rear; skills declare usable and target positions.
- An expedition contains multiple connected nodes, not one battle.
- Supplies come from dungeon stock and are consumed during the expedition.
- Health and stress persist between nodes. Retreat preserves survivors and collected loot but forfeits unsecured rewards.
- Dungeon rooms and facility abilities provide preparation capacity, recovery, scouting, and supply efficiency.
- Death remains permanent. Returning survivors recover through dungeon services rather than automatic full healing.
- Campaign regions end in bosses; only the final `truth_core` boss reveals the truth and wins the run.
- The temporary campaign-order combat-stat multiplier is not part of the target design and must be removed.
- Character level, experience, learned skills, and equipped skills are per-character runtime/save state; `CharacterSO` remains immutable species/archetype authoring data.
- Skill definitions are shared data, while unlock and loadout state belong to each character instance.
- Character skill slots are fixed at one species active, three normal actives, two passives, and one ultimate.
- Potential affects only normal-active rarity odds; traits remain identity modifiers and passives remain event-triggered learned abilities.
- Generated skill state, drafts, narrative facts, retry keys, and use limits are per-world-character save data, never mutable shared ScriptableObject state.
- Skill rules choose rarity, budget, allowed module IDs, and variants before the LLM; invalid output retries under the same hidden request key with no player-facing fallback or generation status.
- The run begins with an owner and two same-species employees after all three have a selected level-one active and validated first passive.
- Old progression saves are intentionally incompatible with the new growth schema and must start a new game.
- `CharacterIdentity.PersistentId` is the sole runtime identity; template IDs never key per-person state.
- Room quality affects facility choice, mood, guests, and eligible work duration only; it never modifies offense stats directly.
- Facilities affect expeditions through crafted equipment and completed recovery use, not ambient combat bonuses.
- Generated skills have rule-authored formation masks and every accepted module must execute in an allowed runtime context.
- V4 rejects duplicate persistent IDs and V3-or-older saves instead of silently merging or migrating person state.
- Gold remains abstract money; non-gold delivery, reward, loot, crafting, shop, and expedition supplies become physical world stacks.
- `DungeonItemCatalogSO` owns item authoring; runtime stack/carry/save state must not be stored on shared ScriptableObjects.
- Item click priority is Character > Item > Building, with Alt-click forcing item pile selection on occupied cells.
- Warehouse inventory becomes an aggregate view of stored physical stacks while loose/carried/reserved items remain visible as separate states.
- Hauling capacity is character-owned and overburden affects movement speed, not global time scale.
- Stored warehouse stacks are hidden in normal play and become visible only through the `물품` view toggle; when stored stacks exist in V5 saves, they resynchronize the warehouse aggregate on restore.
- New runs use `StartPreparationScene` between title and gameplay. Gameplay-scene owner selection remains only as a direct-scene QA fallback.
- Owners have four fixed owner-skill slots in addition to normal generated growth slots. Fixed owner skills are authored static identity data, not LLM-generated or rerolled state.
- Start preparation contains one locked owner, two selected same-species staff, and four reserve staff candidates. Only selected staff enter the run.
- Start preparation treats the owner as ready through fixed owner skills; only selected staff must complete first active/passive start choices.
- Selected and reserve staff can be swapped by dragging roster cards onto each other.
- Player-placed buildings become construction sites with material delivery and work-unit progress; default/new-run seed buildings remain completed.
- Shared SOs may define static work requirements, but delivered materials, reservations, completed work, and queues are runtime/save state.

## Verification Gate

1. Runtime and Editor assemblies compile with Console `Error 0 / Warning 0`.
2. Route generation, node transitions, supplies, stress, formation legality, retreat, death, loot, and boss completion have deterministic tests.
3. Dungeon stock and eligible room/facility effects visibly change expedition preparation and outcomes.
4. UI pointer input can prepare a party, buy/load supplies, choose route branches, resolve nodes, issue formation-valid combat commands, camp, and retreat.
5. Save/load restores the exact route node, party order, health, stress, supplies, loot, battle turn, cooldowns, and statuses without duplication.
6. A clean direct-player run completes all regions and reveals the truth at `truth_core`; no scenario-state injection counts as completion evidence.
7. MCP captures prove readable preparation, route, combat, return, and truth-result screens without overlap or input leakage.
8. Physical item work compiles cleanly before verification; no PlayMode result counts while Unity is running stale assemblies.
9. Stack pile list/detail, carried weight, hauling, warehouse/shop/crafting/expedition item flows, and Alt-click priority are verified by actual pointer/UI tests.
10. V5 save checks include world stacks, stored-warehouse mirrors, hauling settings, and per-character carried inventory.
11. Start preparation checks include title-to-preparation routing, owner fixed skill display, selected/reserve staff swap, prepared snapshot handoff, and no gameplay owner-selection panel in the product flow.
12. V9 work-order checks include construction-site placement, material delivery, partial progress, save/restore, and final building replacement without instant completion.

## Errors Encountered

| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Single-battle campaign became unwinnable at stage 3 | Direct Normal playthrough | Rejected the thin-loop balance patch; redesign offense around persistent multi-node expedition progression and dungeon support. |
| Initial audit searched a nonexistent `Assets/Scripts/Stock` folder | 1 | Located stock runtime under `Buildings/SO/StockInfo.cs` and warehouse query services. |
| Reward regression still expected launch-to-boss and victory full heal | 6 | Reworked it to traverse route nodes, resolve encounters, defeat the boss, grant rewards, and retain survivor injuries. |
| Product-shell verification clicked a recruit card behind the bottom HUD | 7 | Scrolled the card into a 140px bottom-safe region; the pointer-driven product shell then passed. |
| Full-campaign UI verifier selected old alert buttons with matching labels | 7 | Scoped pointer lookup to the active offense map, expedition, or battle panel. |
| QA batch runner introduced `CS1626` by yielding inside `try/catch` | 25 | Moved coroutine yields outside the exception-handled block before rerunning feature tests. |
| Physical item pile PlayMode verifier still used the legacy owner-option flow | 30 | Replaced it with the current start-party fast commit path and added a request-file runner; the pile verifier then passed. |
| Physical item batch wait script looked for `PhysicalItemPile: PASS` while the report writes `[PASS] PhysicalItemPile` | 33 | Treated the shell wait exit code as a harness-string mismatch, then verified the actual batch report, target reports, and Console directly. |
| Recruited staff disappeared from later direct-play expedition candidates | 26 | Made `WorldCharacterProfile.isStaff` authoritative during population bind/refresh/promote/release and prevented the spawner from returning staff profiles to the visitor pool. |
| Offense reward regression still expected instant warehouse stock after physicalization | 26 | Updated reward tests to accept warehouse delta plus physical dropoff stack delta, and aligned recruit-candidate expectations with the handler's minimum-two rule. |
| Physical item theft test could read a duplicate empty carry inventory | 32 | Marked `CharacterCarryInventory` as single-instance and updated fixtures to resolve inventories through `CharacterCarryInventory.Ensure`. |
| Runtime visual-inspection command referenced TMP and wildlife properties that do not exist | 46 | Read the concrete APIs, then queried the TMP `MeshRenderer` sorting data and `WildlifeActor.DisplayName`; the corrected command passed. |
| First zoom persistence fix targeted the legacy `UnityEngine.U2D.PixelPerfectCamera` type | 46 | Runtime component inspection found `UnityEngine.Rendering.Universal.PixelPerfectCamera`; switched the alias to the URP type and reran the pointer test successfully. |
| Pond route probe called a nonexistent two-argument `Grid.SearchPath` overload | 47 | Read the concrete Grid API and used `GetMovePath(start, endPredicate)` instead. |
| Pond route probe started on the occupied entrance-door cell and reported no generic move path | 47 | Tested continuity from the first exterior surface cell; the exterior route and all shallow pond cells are reachable while only the boundary deep-water cell blocks movement. |
| Unity MCP approval was revoked during exact world-click verification | 48 | Used the compiled in-project UI regression request runner to execute the same Input System pointer path and collect the final report without bypassing gameplay input. |
| Physical delivery worker reached the source but could not pick up | Construction material delivery PlayMode attempt 1 | Found warehouse storage IDs were based on shared building definition `GridId`; replace them with a unique building instance key before rerunning. |
| Physical logistics rerun request did not auto-enter PlayMode | Construction material delivery PlayMode attempt 2 | Request file remained pending with Editor idle; enter PlayMode explicitly so the registered runner consumes the same request. |
| PlayMode could not start after warehouse-key migration edit | Construction material delivery compile attempt 2 | Preserved `IWarehouseFacility` type while matching a `BuildableObject` instead of passing the narrowed base type to the storage-key helper. |

## Dark Survival V11 Completion

## Exterior Pond Visibility Completion

- [x] Exclude the entrance and drop zone from default water generation.
- [x] Place one bounded four-cell pond at the outer edge of the longest exterior surface run.
- [x] Ground-align the water visual, unlock per-cell tint, and render a readable pixel-water strip above terrain.

- [x] Verify runtime positions, tile occupancy, camera capture, focused contracts, and Console `Error 0 / Warning 0`.

## Zoom Sky / Centered Dungeon Completion

- [x] Resize and reposition the solid sky from the live orthographic camera viewport whenever zoom, aspect, or camera position changes.
- [x] Center the 27-column dungeon interior inside the 60-column physical world and shift every authored GameplayScene placement by the same offset.
- [x] Center the gameplay camera on the resolved dungeon interior at scene start.
- [x] Verify left and right outer-wall tiles after the shift and visually inspect the maximum zoom-out frame.
- [x] Run physical-world, background-lighting, and grid-foundation regressions with Console `Error 0 / Warning 0`.

### Verification Notes

- Minimum zoom: camera Y `1.25..7.75`, sky Y `-2..11`, coverage `true`.
- Maximum zoom-out: camera Y `-6..15`, sky Y `-8..17`, coverage `true`.
- Runtime dungeon interior is Grid X `17..43`, authored placement shift is `+13`, and camera X matches the dungeon world center at `-29.5`.
- A broader runtime-composition policy scan still reports unrelated pre-existing direct-access violations in other systems; the focused changed-surface regressions pass.

## Entrance Outer-Wall Adjacency Fix

- [x] Reproduce the one-cell gap beside the centered dungeon entrance.
- [x] Exclude characters, wildlife, items, and nonstructural exterior markers from automatic side-wall structure detection.
- [x] Confirm the outer wall moves from Grid X `12` to the correct adjacent cell X `13` beside the three-cell dungeon door.

- [x] Add current-target/open-state diagnostics and a repeated-event regression.
- [x] Add two consecutive Input System pointer clicks to the world-info PlayMode verifier.
- [x] Verify wildlife contracts, UI regression batch, and Console `Error 0 / Warning 0`.

## Wildlife World-Facing Completion

- [x] Trace wildlife facing against the project's mirrored Grid-to-world X mapping.
- [x] Derive horizontal facing from world-space movement instead of logical Grid X delta.
- [x] Update the natural-motion regression to assert left/right in world space.
- [x] Verify every wildlife species present in GameplayScene in both horizontal directions.

## Defense Interception And Engagement V12

- [x] Audit current invasion movement, guard commands, defense UI, DI, persistence, and compile state.
- [x] Add adjacent-cell interception, reciprocal combat, one lead guard, and one replacement guard.
- [x] Add RimWorld-style defense policies assigned per guard and owner evacuation to an administration room.
- [x] Connect manual suppression, skill events, combat presentation, player-facing status, and defense UI.
- [x] Persist policies, assignments, owner evacuation, and active engagements in V12 saves.
- [x] Verify focused contracts, pointer-driven PlayMode combat, captures, and Console gameplay `Error 0 / Warning 0` after the known Unity 6000.3.8 startup warning.

### Defense Decisions

- Automatic interception is limited to on-duty non-owner staff with Guard priority enabled.
- Melee combat is one blocker versus one intruder on separate adjacent cells; a second guard may wait behind for replacement but cannot attack through the lead guard.
- Defense behavior is configured through named policies and each guard is assigned one policy.
- The owner never auto-dispatches. Every invasion cancels the owner's current action and evacuates them to an Administration room, or the farthest reachable interior safe cell when no valid room exists.
- Empty frontline means the intruder resumes advancing immediately; zero health continues to use the existing permanent-death flow.

## Developer Mode And Debug Palette

- [x] Add settings schema V2 with developer mode disabled by default and a dedicated Development tab.
- [x] Add a center-top Debug button, responsive non-modal palette, search, numeric input, eight command tabs, and exact world targeting.
- [x] Register 112 modular commands across cheats, spawning, characters, building/work, survival/wildlife, defense/events, overlays, and history.
- [x] Connect persistent `debugModified` metadata and a 50-entry command history while resetting transient cheats and overlays after load.
- [x] Verify pointer targeting, Shift repeat, right-click/Escape cancellation, commands, invasions, save behavior, overlays, and both supported aspect ratios.
- [x] Finish with EditMode PASS, PlayMode `RESULT=PASS`, Camera Capture comparison, and Console `Error 0 / Warning 0`.

## Construction Material Physical Delivery

- [x] Trace construction placement, delivery request, warehouse reservation, pickup, and site deposit.
- [x] Remove any construction-site material spawning or teleporting at placement time.
- [x] Keep materials physically stored until a worker picks up the reserved quantity and deposits it into the site buffer.
- [x] Add regressions for no-stock waiting, partial reservation, pickup, deposit, and construction readiness.
- [x] Verify the live placement-to-haul flow and Console `Error 0 / Warning 0`.

## Medieval Dark Fantasy Combat V13

- [x] Add shared melee, ranged, and recoverable-throw resolution with range bands, fire modes, evasion, directional cover, friendly-fire gating, armor penetration, body parts, bleeding, suppression, and pause-safe presentation.
- [x] Add individual weapon, armor, shield, and ammunition data plus persistent equipment instances, quality, armor durability, loadouts, reloads, crafting recipes, and V13 save state.
- [x] Connect defense to rally-time physical loadout pickup, post-breach melee interception, ranged line-of-sight combat, reciprocal damage, owner evacuation, and recoverable thrown equipment.
- [x] Connect offense to the same resolver, formation distance, cover, weapon switching, ammunition, body-part injuries, suppression turn loss, and persistent return-state wounds.
- [x] Add combat UI, cover buildings, exact multi-select/direct movement commands, fire-mode/hold-fire controls, and player-facing combat status.
- [x] Connect wildlife hunting and retaliation to the shared combat resolver, ranged firing positions, scaled-time reloads, simplified persistent body profiles, and real armor/body damage on hunters.
- [x] Verify static combat/offense/defense/priority/wildlife contracts, PlayMode wildlife loop, defense rally and engagement, direct movement and cancellation, visual capture, and Console `Error 0 / Warning 0`.

### V13 Verification Notes

- Defense PlayMode: rally held outside, four reciprocal exchanges on distinct adjacent cells, both sides damaged, intruder movement and facility attacks locked, owner evacuation and save snapshot valid.
- Player command PlayMode: `Cain (19,0) -> (17,0)` completed with manual lock released; a second move cancelled immediately also released its lock.
- Wildlife PlayMode: runtime snapshot and hunt/carcass/butcher loop passed; limb injury lowers mobility and survives capture/restore.
- `ScreenCapture`: `Artifacts/QA/combat-v13-defense-final.png`.
- Unity MCP `Camera_Capture` was attempted twice against the live Main Camera but the connector returned `Failed to render scene preview`; the direct Game View capture rendered correctly.
